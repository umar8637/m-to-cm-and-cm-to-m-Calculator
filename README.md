# Meter to Centimeter and Centimeter to Meter Calculator

This is a simple web-based calculator project that converts between meters and centimeters. It allows you to input a value in either meters or centimeters and automatically calculates and displays the corresponding conversion in the other unit.

## Usage

To use the Meter to Centimeter and Centimeter to Meter Calculator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Enter a value in either the "Meters" or "Centimeters" input field.
4. The calculator will automatically update the other input field with the converted value.

## Requirements

The Meter to Centimeter and Centimeter to Meter Calculator project has the following requirements:

- HTML5 compatible web browser.

## Files

The project repository contains the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that displays the calculator interface.
- `centimeter to meter and meter to centimeter calculator.css`: The CSS file that styles the calculator interface.
- `centimeter to meter and meter to centimeter calculator.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the conversion logic.

## How It Works

The `index.html` file contains the structure of the calculator interface, including the input fields for meters and centimeters. The CSS file `centimeter to meter and meter to centimeter calculator.css` provides the styling for the interface.

The conversion logic is implemented in the JavaScript file `centimeter to meter and meter to centimeter calculator.js`. When the value in the "Meters" input field changes, the corresponding value in centimeters is calculated by multiplying the input value by 100. Similarly, when the value in the "Centimeters" input field changes, the corresponding value in meters is calculated by dividing the input value by 100. The calculated values are then updated in the other input field.
